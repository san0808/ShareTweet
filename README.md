## Technologies Used

- Next.js: Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and other performance optimizations.

- Twitter API: The Twitter API allows developers to access and interact with various Twitter functionalities, such as retrieving tweet details and media.

## Installation

To run ShareTweet locally on your machine, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/san0808/ShareTweet.git

cd ShareTweet

npm install

checkout the express sever here https://github.com/san0808/ShareTweetBackend

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
